        <p>Lab scientists are no longer required to analyse the data collected by computers in a research laboratory -
            patients and doctors can now log into Web-based information portals to coordinate treatment plans and
            schedule
            appointments. There is also increasing usage of mobile and wearable devices, to keep track of dosage
            schedules
            and monitor vital information such as heart rate and blood pressure.</p>

        <p>Programming jobs in the medical field fall into two categories: software engineering and research. The type
            of
            research varies depending on where the work takes place. Researchers working in hospitals and universities
            are
            typically working on cutting-edge technology. This work is often published in scientific journals, and is
            mostly general and theoretical. Funding for this research usually comes from government grants.</p>
