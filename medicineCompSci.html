<h1>Computer Science in Medicine</h1>
<div><p>Lab scientists are no longer required to analyse the data collected by computers in a research laboratory - patients and doctors can now log into Web-based information portals to coordinate treatment plans and schedule appointments. There is also increasing usage of mobile and wearable devices, to keep track of dosage schedules and monitor vital information such as heart rate and blood pressure.</p></div>

<div><p>Programming jobs in the medical field fall into two categories: software engineering and research. The type of research varies depending on where the work takes place. Researchers working in hospitals and universities are typically working on cutting-edge technology. This work is often published in scientific journals, and is mostly general and theoretical. Funding for this research usually comes from government grants.</p></div>
